hdmi-switcher
=====================

#### About

Simple Ubuntu app indicator to switch between HDMI/DVI screens and HDMI/"my other sound device" sound ouput. Everything is pretty much hardcoded, but it's not exactly rocket science what is going on... (well maybe that change_audio.sh is not really straightforward)

#### "Requirements" ~ my working environment
- Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
- Python 3.5.2
